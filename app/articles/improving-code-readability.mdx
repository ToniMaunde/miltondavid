I believe that writing code can, in a way, be compared to telling a story where the order of the events matter and the role of each character has to be well thought out in order to make it engaging and understandable.

So, in this article I'll share some of the coding practices I believe to be helpful to write predictable, engaging and easy to understand codebases.

> The code snippets are written in JavaScript but these apply to most programming languages 😉 .

### 1. Writing booleans in the affirmative form
Variables holding boolean values become more intuitive when in the affirmative form since they are a statement and not a question.
```js
const users = [
  {
    name: "John Doe",
    status: "online"
  },
  {
    name: "Jane Doe",
    status: "offline"
  }
];
const onlineUsers = users.filter(user => user.status === "online");

// ❌
const areThereOnlineUsers = onlineUsers.length > 0;
// ✅
const thereAreOnlineUsers = onlineUsers.length > 0;
```
These prevents cognitive gymnastics like
```js
// Hard to infer whether there are users or not
if (areThereOnlineUsers) {...}
```
in favour of much cleaner code such as
```js
if (thereAreOnlineUsers) {...}
```

### 2. Avoiding the dot notation in conditional rendering
It is far easier to understand the condtion driving the render of an element if it expressed in words (a variable) instead of having to verifying the type of the object being accessed, the properties it possesses and then which condition is being used.
```js

```
