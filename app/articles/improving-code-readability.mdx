I believe that writing code can, in a way, be compared to telling a story where the order of the events matter and the role of each character has to be well thought out in order to make it engaging and understandable.

So, in this article I'll share some of the coding practices I believe to be helpful to write predictable, engaging and easy to understand codebases.

### 1. Writing booleans in the affirmative form
Variables holding boolean values become more intuitive when in the affirmative form since they are a statement and not a question.
```js
const users = [
  {
    name: "John Doe",
    status: "online"
  },
  {
    name: "Jane Doe",
    status: "offline"
  }
];
  
// ❌
const areThereOnlineUsers = users.filter(user => user.status === "online");
// ✅
const thereAreOnlineUsers = users.filter(user => user.status === "online");
```
